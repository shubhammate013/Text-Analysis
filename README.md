# Text-Analysis
Text Analysis, also known as Text Mining or Natural Language Processing (NLP), is a technique used to extract meaningful information, patterns and insights from unstructured text data, including documents, emails, social media posts, customer reviews, and more. It involves various techniques such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modelling, and text classification.


Text Analysis involves various techniques such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modelling, and text classification. Text analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and making sense of large volumes of text data, which is prevalent in various domains, including news articles, social media, customer reviews, and more.

   1. Gather the text data from various sources.
   2. Clean and preprocess the text data.
   3. Convert the text into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.
   4. Analyze the text data to gain insights.
   5. Create relevant features from the text data if necessary.
   6. Select appropriate NLP models for your task.

We have a dataset consisting of articles and their corresponding titles. Each article contains text that covers various topics related to data analysis, machine learning, and related fields. The titles provide a concise summary of the main subject or theme of each article.

The goal is to perform comprehensive text analysis on the provided dataset of articles and titles. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

    _Create word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in the titles.
    _Analyze the sentiment expressed in the articles to understand the overall tone or sentiment of the content.
    _Extract named entities such as organizations, locations, and other relevant information from the articles.
    _Apply topic modeling techniques to uncover latent topics within the articles.
